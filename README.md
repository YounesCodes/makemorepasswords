# makemorepasswords

In this repo, I followed Andrej Karpathy's Neural Network series where he builds makemore, a name 'generator', with different NN architectures, I made it into a password generator based on the famous rockyou.txt file that contains millions of passwords leaked from popular social app rockyou.


# RockYou.txt file backstory (https://www.keepersecurity.com/blog/2023/08/04/understanding-rockyou-txt-a-tool-for-security-and-a-weapon-for-hackers/)

The RockYou.txt wordlist originated from a significant data breach that occurred in 2009. RockYou, a social app and advertising network, suffered a devastating cyber attack that led to the exposure of over 32 million user passwords. The passwords were stored in plaintext, a cardinal sin in cybersecurity, making them easy pickings for the attackers.

The leaked passwords were compiled into a wordlist, now known as the RockYou.txt file. This list has since become a standard tool in password cracking and network testing due to its real-world representation of user password selection habits.
